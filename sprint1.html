    <p>These photo's were taken at the top of Wairere falls in Matamata.
      I was travelling the north Island in my camper-van (living the life).
      During my travels, I did a lot of hiking including the great walk Lake Waikaremoana.

<h4>
Name 5 commands you used, and what they do

<li>cd - changes directory </li>
<li>git status - show's current status of git </li>
<li>git pull origin master - Pull's everything from master branch</li>
<li>git commit - after any input to your git, git commit will take a "screenshot" you can also add a message with -m </li>  
</ul>

<h4>
Did you learn anything unexpected?
